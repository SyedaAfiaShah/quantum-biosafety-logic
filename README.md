🧬 Quantum Logic Simulation of a Biosafety Decision System in a “Pollutant-Eating” Biospray
🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how biological decision-making logic—originally designed for a synthetic biology biospray—can be represented through quantum logic circuits using Qiskit.

The concept is inspired by the Pollutant-Eating Biospray Project, where harmless engineered bacteria are programmed to detect and degrade toxic airborne pollutants (like soot-borne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). These bacteria act as microscopic cleaners that activate when pollutants are present and deactivate or self-destruct when safety rules are violated.

This repository explores how the biosafety control logic used in such a biological system can be modeled and simulated on a quantum computer.

⚙️ Biological Inspiration

In the biospray design, each bacterial cell follows a simple decision-making process:

✅ Survive if pollutants are detected (normal condition).

🔁 Replicate only in controlled conditions.

💀 Self-destruct (kill signal) if:

T (Timer): The bacterium has not detected pollutants for too long.

M (Mutation): Genetic damage or mutation is detected.

G (Geosensing): The bacterium drifts outside a predefined safe geography.

The biosafety rule can be summarized as:

K = T + M + G

where K is the kill signal (1 = terminate, 0 = survive).
This rule is implemented as a quantum circuit that models the same logical relationships in a reversible, computational way.

💻 Quantum Logic Model

In this project, we map each biological input to a quantum bit (qubit) and use quantum gates to reproduce the logic of the biosafety kill-switch.

Biological Signal	Symbol	Qubit	Description
Mutation detected	M	q₀	Triggers kill signal if true
Timer expired (pollutant absent)	T	q₁	Triggers kill signal after delay
Geosensing out of range	G	q₂	Detects unsafe environment
Kill output	K	q₄	Activated when any trigger = 1
🔬 Implementation Details

The simulation is implemented in Python using the Qiskit quantum computing framework.

Core Features:

Construction of a reversible quantum circuit for the biosafety rule.

Classical vs Quantum truth table comparison.

Quantum superposition simulation to explore all input states simultaneously.

Noisy backend simulation to test performance under real hardware-like errors.

Histogram visualizations for probability outcomes.

🧩 Circuit Logic

The quantum circuit uses:

CNOT (CX) gates to propagate single-input signals.

Toffoli (CCX) gates to handle multi-input logic combinations.

Hadamard (H) gates to introduce quantum superposition across input states.

These gates work together to compute:

K = T + M + G

The circuit remains reversible, meaning that no information is destroyed—just like in biological regulation, where signals can be reversed or overridden under controlled feedback.

📊 Simulations

The notebook runs three key simulations:

1. Classical vs Quantum Truth Table

Compares deterministic (classical) logic output with probabilistic quantum results for all input combinations of M, T, and G.

2. Quantum Superposition Simulation

Places all input qubits in superposition using Hadamard gates to visualize the full outcome distribution of possible environmental conditions.

3. Noisy Quantum Simulation

Adds realistic hardware noise using Qiskit’s Aer noise model.
This mirrors biological uncertainty—just as bacteria experience imperfect sensing or environmental fluctuations.

🧠 Insights

Ideal Circuit: Produces perfect results where the kill signal activates for any safety violation.

Noisy Simulation: Demonstrates probabilistic deviations, similar to biological “noise” or imperfect gene regulation.

Takeaway: Biological safety circuits and quantum logic both rely on conditional decision-making and redundancy for robustness.
